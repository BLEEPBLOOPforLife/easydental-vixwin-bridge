# Easy Dental VixWin Bridge
A program used to integrate Easy Dental with VixWin better. The current VxLink version seems to be prone to bugs/crashes, so this is designed as a replacement for it.

## Install Instructions

2. Click the "EZ/VX" icon in the tray when you have a patient open in Easy Dental to open VixWin.
